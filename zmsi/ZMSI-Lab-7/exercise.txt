1. Familiarize yourself with the engine Planning by analyzing files
rules/BlocksWorld.arl and rules/BlocksWorldHTN.arl.
   In particular, observe that the plan in the first file is executed automatically, 
   and observe that a rule in the second file is described as a composition using the 
   section expanssion.

2. Using the engine Planning solve the classic problem Monkey and Bananas:

A monkey is in a room at a location A, containing a box at a location B and a bunch of bananas 
at a location C.
The bananas are hanging from the ceiling out of reach of the monkey.
What sequence of actions will allow the monkey to get the bananas?
(The monkey is supposed to go to the box, push it under the bananas, climb on top of it and 
grasp the bananas.)
The monkey knows how to: move around, carry other things, climb things, reach to banana.

3. The first programs in STRIPS were supposed to control the robot Shakey.
   Shakey is able to lift and to drop boxes, to climb the boxes and to jump down from them,
   to move from one location to another, and to turn on/off the light (however, in order
   to reach the switch, it needed to stand on a box). Using the engine Planning describe 
   the world depicted in the attached picture (shakey.png) and generate a plan, which allows 
   the robot to turn on the light in all the rooms.
