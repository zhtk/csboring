1. Familiarize yourself with the applications in packages buffer, property and event, 
presenting different types of communication in ABLE. Classes *App contain methods main which can be 
used to run the program.
2. Implementation of the Collatz conjecture. Using the communication through Events,
 create a group of agents connected in a ring. Your program should pass a natural 
 number (a constant or a number read from the standard input) to the ring. Each agent 
 after receiving the number x should perform the following operation: 
 if x%2=0 then x/=2 else x=3x+1, and next it should pass the number to the next agent
 (unless x == 1) or to pass to the main program information on how many steps have been performed 
 (if x == 1). The program should print to the standard output the number of steps and terminate.
3. Using one of the sets of rules created on the previous classes, create an app using 
the agent implementing AbleRuleAgentImpl.
